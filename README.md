# Feira
A basically test site for the Book Fair (college)

In my college we tried to make a simple website for html and css training. To upgrade my code, I tried to preload based on the theme of this one.
I used JavaScript to make the preload work.

I was going to try to make a login system, but I didn't.

And I also used Guga's photo, because my nickname in college is Guga.
